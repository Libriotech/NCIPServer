=head1 NAME

Header - Response Header as Defined in z39.83-1-2012

=head1 SYNOPSIS



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a NCIP ResponseHeader object.  We do not implement an
initator, so we do not implement the InitiationHeader and we do not
attempt to make this object generic enough to handle that field.
The fields are as defined in Z39.83-1-2012.  Ext is provided but is
not used by the current iteration of NCIPServer.
